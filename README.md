## MaintenaSense - Predictive Maintenance System

### Overview
MaintenaSense is a predictive maintenance system designed to reduce unexpected machinery breakdowns in manufacturing environments. By leveraging smart sensor data (e.g., vibration, temperature, and machine status), it predicts failures before they occur, allowing maintenance teams to schedule proactive repairs and minimize downtime.

### Features
- Real-Time Data Integration – Ingests live sensor readings for up-to-date machine health monitoring.
- Predictive Alerts – Uses LSTM & GRU models to forecast machine failures.
- Customizable Dashboards – Provides interactive visualizations for maintenance teams.
- Automated Maintenance Scheduling – Recommends optimal service windows.
- API Integration – Connects with ERP and CMMS systems for seamless workflows.
